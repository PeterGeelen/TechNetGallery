In some cases you need the last page of a document to be on an even page number.

Typically an even page at the end is set to have cover information, while ending up with un-even pages, the last printed page has a blank/unprinted last page.

To avoid this last blank page, you can use a Word function to check for the page number and automattically add a 'Notes' pages before the last page.

This allows you to keep the last printed page as the cover page.

 

In many forums, there have been quite some discussions including instructions...

But in many cases, it's not easy to tell how a <page break> must be added, so a working sample might be more clear.

 

A companion page on TN Wiki is in the works, including a lot of reference material.
