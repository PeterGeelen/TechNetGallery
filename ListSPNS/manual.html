<p>There are a lot of hints &amp; tips out there for troubleshooting SPNs (service 
principal names).</p>
<p>Listing duplicate SPNs is fairly easy, use the “setspn -X” command and you’ll 
find out.</p>
<p>But how do you find out which SPNs are used for which users and computers are 
used for this?</p><p>
So you need a general script to list all SPNs, for all 
users and all computers…</p><p>
Nice fact to know, SPNs are set as an attribute 
on the user or computer accounts.</p><p>
So that makes it fairly ease to query for 
that attribute.</p><p>
And modern admins do PowerShell, right?</p><p>

How to use the script: to avoid certificate issues, download the txt file and 
remove the txt extension. Then use the PS1 file to list the SPNs.</p><hr>
