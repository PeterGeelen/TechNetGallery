Many Wiki articles use colors. Unfortunately, in some cased the colors specified in HTML using RGB values are not displayed correctly (it seems to be linked to the browser version used by the editor.)
This script provides a way to load the HTML source code into memory (by using copy, ctrl+c), then using a script to replace the RGB codes in color names, and pasting back the HTML code into the Wiki article.
